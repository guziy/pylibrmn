About
------------
This is a python wrapper around the C/FORTRAN library librmn, which is used for reading RPN files.
The wrapping is done using ctypes python package. The library works with Python 2.7 or later.


News
------------
Recently, in the attempt to simplify the interface of the library and make it usable with dask, the library API was updated. The interface similar to the nteCDF4 was added. 
So now it is possible to extract data from a file in 3 lines of code. 


```python
# This example reads precipitation data from a file into a 
# 4D numpy array with the dimensions (time, level, lon, lat)
from rpn.rpn import RPN
with RPN("pm1979010100_03506400p") as r:
    pr_data = r.variables["PR"][:]
    
```

Moreover, it is possible to get some information about the variables even without reading the data into 
memory, which makes it a perfect candidate for use with dask.  

```python
# This example reads precipitation variable metadata without actually reading of the precipitation data
# into memory. In order to get data in memory you have to slice the variable. 
from rpn.rpn import RPN
with RPN("pm1979010100_03506400p") as r:
    pr_var = r.variables["PR"]

    # you can also get the list of fields in the file as below
    print(r.variables)

    # get the shape of the data (still no field values are read)
    print(pr_var.shape)
    
    # get the dates correponding to the time dimension
    print([str(d) for d in pr_var.sorted_dates])
    
    # get the level values corresponing to the vertical dimension
    print([lev for lev in pr_var.sorted_levels])
```


```

Out[4]: array([ 0.])
```

**Note**: that the code above should not use the variable outside the with block, because the file is closed upon exit from the block.
If you want to defer the reading of the data and keep variables, you can use the library as follows:

```python
from rpn.rpn import RPN
r =  RPN("pm1979010100_03506400p")
pr_var = r.variables["PR"]
agg = do_stuff(pr_var)
r.close()
```



Examples
------------

The examples moved to the [wiki](https://github.com/guziy/pylibrmn/wiki) of the project.

Requirements
------------
This package is a wrapper around the FORTRAN version of librmn, so it needs this library installed.

* librmn.so (FORTRAN library)
* ctypes (a python package)
* numpy (python package)
* nose (if you want to run tests)


Installation
------------

* `pip` can be used to install the package:

```
     pip install pylibrmn
     
```
* If you are not working in a virtual environment, you can install the package in your home

```
    pip install pylibrmn --user -U
```

* If you have a specific version of the C/FORTRAN base rmnlib library, you can force pyrmnlib to use it by setting this environment variable during install:
```
    export LIBRMN_PATH_FOR_PY=/unique/armnssm/ECssm/ssm-domains-base/libs/rmnlib-dev/multi/lib/Linux_x86-64/gfortran-4.9/librmnshared_015.so
```

It will work provided, you have the FORTRAN version of rmnlib (shared version) and ssm packages needed for compilation and linking of the bridge between FROTRAN and Python.
I use the following commands to prepare my environment:

     . <my_python_env>/bin/activate
     . s.ssmuse.dot fulldev-gcc-46
     . s.ssmuse.dot devtools 
     . s.ssmuse.dot diagtools ###Not necessary for using pylibrmn but used for unit testing

The following shortcuts were reported to work on UQAM servers (May 2017):

     . s.ssmuse.dot fulldev-gcc-46 rmnlib-dev


To run the tests in ipython:


    In [1]: cd <path to site-packages folder>/rpn

    In [2]: import nose

    In [5]: nose.run()

Contributing

Any contributions either through bug reports, feature requests or documentation enhancements (e.g. by sending your usage examples) are very welcome. 


Install using `setup.py` and development version of the project from github
------------------------------------------------------------

An alternative way to install this module (you might need to have sudo rights to do it in your default python installation or use
virtualenv to create the writable environment. I prefer working with virtualenv and advise you to give it a go, see [this] (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) for more
information):

* Clone this repository using git (or just download .zip archive exported by github):
       
        git  clone  https://github.com/guziy/pylibrmn.git
 
    or if you have a github account you can use ssh link:

        git clone git@github.com:guziy/pylibrmn.git
        

* Install the python wrapper to the site-pacakges directory. `--record` is used so you know which files are copied
   and where (it creates the file files.txt with the list of installed files which you could delete when uninstalling).

        python setup.py install --record files.txt

   It will create `libpyrmn.so` in the current directory.

* Put the compiled library somewhere in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
     I have put it in the `site-packages/python2.7/` directory, since it is already in my `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

* Note: in order to install on guillimin, you have to use `Makefile.guill`, and load ssm package for gfortran beforehand (from the cmmand line).

        . s.ssmuse.dot gfortran-4.6 rmnlib-dev

  To see what else can be used through ssm, do:
        
        s.list_ssm_shortcuts

  To make using the specified make file (`Makefile.guill` in this case) you could do the following:
         
        mv Makefile Makefile.default
        mv Makefile.guill Makefile
        python setup.py install

  *Update:* The same Makefile should work on guillimin and skynet or other system with unified environment installed.

* To test the library you will need `nose` (install using `pip install nose`):

        cd pylibrmn
        nosetests

  You should see something similar in the case of success:
